The files in this project were written and edited by me, Ethan Heidtman, beginning in the summer of 2023. 
Together, they are all of the code that I personally wrote for my University of Maryland Department of Geology Senior Thesis Project
The title of this project is "Investigation of High-Elevation Drivers of Snowpack and Streamflow Characteristics in the American West"
I worked with Dr. Karen Prestegaard of the Department of Geology at UMD.
The file Functions.R contains some miscellaneous functions that I wrote, borrowed, and referenced on many different occasions throughout 
this project. These functions are mainly for loading, working, and writing different data files that I used for this project.

Use of this code is only as authorized in writing by me, Ethan Heidtman.
